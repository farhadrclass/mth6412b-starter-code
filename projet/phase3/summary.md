# Objective
The third part of the project consists in implementing a second method of construction of a minimal spanning tree given a connected undirected graph. 

# How to proceed
1. Implement the two acceleration heuristics and answer the question
about the rank ;
2. Implement the Prim algorithm seen in the lab;
3. test your implementation on the lecture notes example and various instances of TSP symmetric in your unit tests.

# Guidelines
Write readable, well-organized, documented and commented code. You may wish to refer to the guidelines for writing Julia code: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide
Your methods must be documented according to the schema given in the official Julia documentation: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation
Submit your report in the form of a Pluto notebook in PDF format on Moodle and record the julia jl version on the phase X branch of your fork.
Markdown cells should guide the reader through your report.

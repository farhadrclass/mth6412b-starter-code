Objective
The second part of the project is to construct a minimal spanning tree given a undirected graph.

Steps to follow
1. Choose and implement a data structure for the related components of a graph;
2. implement the Kruskal algorithm and test it on the example of the lecture notes;
3. accompany your code with unit tests;
4. test your implementation on various instances of symmetric TSP in a program and comment.
